              >Nadi Shodhana is a breathing technique that helps you to calm
              down whenever you feel anxiousness or agitation. It involves
              inhaling deeply through the left nostril, while you hold and close
              your right nostril with your right thumb. Alternately, close your
              left nostril with your left thumb and exhale through your right
              nostril. After you exhale, continue by inhaling through the right
              nostril and close it when you reach the peak of your inhalation.
              Now lift the finger from your left nostril and exhale completely.
              Continue this process, alternately breathing through each nostril
              and practice it for up to 3 to 5 minutes or as comfortable. Make
              sure that you are breathing effortlessly and focus on the process
              of inhalation and exhalation. The above method can be performed by
              beginners. An advanced version of pranayama includes breathing
              (inhaling, exhaling and breath retention) for a particular time or
              count. A more advanced type of yogic breathing (known as
              Rajadhiraja system) combines alternate nostril breathing along
              with focusing on certain chakras while chanting a mantra.</span

              ><strong>Ujjayi or Ocean’s Breath:</strong><br />Ujjayi pranayama
              is often referred to as a cooling pranayama, as it helps to soothe
              and calm the mind when you feel irritated, frustrated or angry.
              This involves inhaling slightly deeper than normal and then
              exhaling through the nose while closing the mouth and constricting
              the muscles of the throat. It is called as Ocean’s breath, as this
              breathing technique when performed correctly produces sounds like
              the waves of the ocean. For practice, one can try making the sound
              ‘haaaaah’ by exhaling keeping the mouth open. Similarly it can be
              practiced to produce a similar sound with the mouth closed and
              flowing out the air through the nasal passage. With consistency
              and practice, one can practice the same method while inhaling,
              gently constricting the throat as you inhale. Ujjayi pranayama
              technique helps to improve the energy levels and with regular
              practice improves the breathing.<br

              ears during the exhalation process, which helps to enhance the

          >Nadi Shodhana is a breathing technique that helps you to calm down
          whenever you feel anxiousness or agitation. It involves inhaling
          deeply through the left nostril, while you hold and close your right
          nostril with your right thumb. Alternately, close your left nostril
          with your left thumb and exhale through your right nostril. After you
          exhale, continue by inhaling through the right nostril and close it
          when you reach the peak of your inhalation. Now lift the finger from
          your left nostril and exhale completely. Continue this process,
          alternately breathing through each nostril and practice it for up to 3
          to 5 minutes or as comfortable. Make sure that you are breathing
          effortlessly and focus on the process of inhalation and exhalation.
          The above method can be performed by beginners. An advanced version of
          pranayama includes breathing (inhaling, exhaling and breath retention)
          for a particular time or count. A more advanced type of yogic
          breathing (known as Rajadhiraja system) combines alternate nostril
          breathing along with focusing on certain chakras while chanting a
          mantra.</span

    </h3>
    <p>
      Ujjayi pranayama is often referred to as a cooling pranayama, as it helps
      to soothe and calm the mind when you feel irritated, frustrated or angry.
      This involves inhaling slightly deeper than normal and then exhaling
      through the nose while closing the mouth and constricting the muscles of
      the throat. It is called as Ocean’s breath, as this breathing technique
      when performed correctly produces sounds like the waves of the ocean. For
      practice, one can try making the sound ‘haaaaah’ by exhaling keeping the
      mouth open. Similarly it can be practiced to produce a similar sound with
      the mouth closed and flowing out the air through the nasal passage. With
      consistency and practice, one can practice the same method while inhaling,
      gently constricting the throat as you inhale. Ujjayi pranayama technique
      helps to improve the energy levels and with regular practice improves the
      breathing.

      This yoga breathing technique helps to reduce pitta (heat) in the body and
      improves digestion. This technique is practiced by folding the tongue
      lengthwise and inhaling deeply through the fold. Then closing the mouth,
      hold the breath on a count of eight and then exhale through the nose.
      Continue this for eight breaths, sustain for a maximum of eight minutes.
      This yogic breathing technique should be avoided by people suffering from
      asthma, bronchitis and chronic constipation.

      This technique is somewhat similar to Shiitali Kumbhaka and has the same
      benefits. This involves inhaling through the nosae, holding the breath for
      eight seconds and then exhaling through the mouth – while resting teeth on
      the tongue and making a sound s-s-s with the tongue. In addition to the
      benefits of reducing pitta (heat), this yogic breathing technique also
      purifies the senses. The contradictions are similar to that of Shiitali
      Kumbhaka, and the practice of both the Shiitali and Siitkari should be
      avoided for a period of one hour before and after the practice of

      Brahmari, also known as the humming breath involves inhalation technique
      similar to that of ujjayi and during the exhalation the person has to hum
      like a bee. The humming sound results in a resonating vibration in the
      head and the heart. Take ten deep breaths and then ten deep Brahmari
      breaths while closing both the ears during the exhalation process, which
      helps to enhance the resonating effect and the benefits. Brahmari helps to
      balance the vata (circulation or flow) and also improves both mental and
      emotion awareness. This technique should always be practiced in a sitting
      (upright) position.

      Slowly try to extend the inhalations and exhalations as you walk. Count

      ten more steps for next inhales and exhales. This technique benefits by
      calming the breathing along with having an active lifestyle.

          >This is an advanced yogic breathing technique and hence must be
          performed under supervision only. This breathing technique is
          performed by closing the right nostril and inhale twenty rapid
          bellows-like breaths through the left nostril. Perform twenty more
          bellows breath through the right nostril while keeping the left
          nostril closed. Repeat the same process with alternate nostril.
          Bhastrika helps to bring prana into the mind and the body, and thus
          clears mental, emotion and physical blocks.</span

          >As practiced in Nadi Shodhana, Surya Bhedana also involves inhaling
          through the right nostril and exhaling through the left nostril.
          Repeat this process for a minimum of six breaths and maximum of ten
          breaths or as per comfort. This yogic breathing technique helps to
          balance the vata in the body by including heating and warming breaths.
          Surya Bhedana should not be performed by people suffering from heart
          disease, hypertension, epilepsy, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer and

          >Active yogic breathing technique involves practicing long, slow and
          deep breathing, in and out through the nose while you walk at a
          moderate pace. Slowly try to extend the inhalations and exhalations as
          you walk. Count the steps taken during each full inhale and exhale.
          Aim to take five to ten more steps for next inhales and exhales. This
          technique benefits by calming the breathing along with having an
          active lifestyle.</span

      >Yogic breathing or Pranayama is an ancient practice which people have
      been practicing of thousands of years. It involves conscious and mindful
      breathing techniques corresponding to various yogic postures. Although
      some researches do mention the benefits of practicing yoga, but more work
      needs to be conducted. Although yoga techniques are simple and safe to
      practice at home, but it is always recommended to do it under the guidance
      of a trained yoga teacher.</span
